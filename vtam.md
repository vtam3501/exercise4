## Summary
Monaka is a type of traditional Japanese dessert that consist of an outer crispy wafer with a sweet filling inside such as red bean paste, mochi, ice cream or chestnut paste. The wafer is made with mochiko flour but isn't considered a mochi. It has a texture similar to an ice cream cone. Kakigori is a traditional Japanese summer dessert with origins dating back to the 11th century Heian Period. It is made by carving a block of pure ice using a special machine, and adding toppings to create flavors like mango or melon. Taiyaki is a Japanese fish-shaped cake. It is made using regular pancake or waffle batter. The batter is poured into a fish-shaped mold for each side. The filling is then put on one side and the mold is closed. All three are famous and popular Japanese desserts that can be found in many dessert shops in New York City.

## Monaka

### About 
Monaka (最中) is a Japanese sweet made of azuki bean jam filling sandwiched between two thin crisp wafers made from mochi. The jam can be made from azuki beans but also with sesame seed, chestnuts, or rice cake (Mochi). Modern monaka can also be eaten filled with ice cream. The wafers can be square, triangular, or may be shaped like cherry blossoms, chrysanthemums and so on. Monaka is a type of dessert (wagashi) which is served with tea. There are still many very famous monaka specialty stores in Japan.

### Where to Buy It
Monaka can be bought in any Japanese supermarket and can be found in the freeezer aisle. Depending on the manufacturers, there are many versions of monaka. For example, there are panda shaped ones, which are wonderful as a kid's treat, with chocolate and filled with vanilla cream. In another variation, it's aerated milk chocolate between those crispy wafers and imprinted with a flower pattern. Each seller of this popular snack has their own recipe and technique, meaning varieties can sometimes differ heavily. Accordingly, fans are always keen to seek out a new type and queues are not uncommon.


## Kakigori 

### About 
Kakigori is a Japanese shaved ice dessert flavored with syrup and a sweetener, often condensed milk. The origins of kakigōri date back to the 11th century, when blocks of ice saved during the colder months would be shaved and served with sweet syrup to Japanese aristocracy during the summer. Kakigōri became more accessible in the 19th century, when ice became more widely available to the public during the summertime.

## Taiyaki

### About 
Taiyaki (鯛焼き , literally "baked sea bream") is a Japanese fish-shaped cake. It imitates the shape of Tai (Japanese Red seabream). It is also the origin of the name. The most common filling is red bean paste that is made from sweetened azuki beans. Other common fillings may be custard, chocolate, cheese, or sweet potato. Some shops even sell taiyaki with okonomiyaki, gyoza filling, or a sausage inside.

### Where to Buy It
One of the stores where taiyaki can be bought is in Taiyaki NYC. First established in the cultural melting pot of Chinatown, New York, Taiyaki NYC has since expanded to the arts district of Wynwood Miami, Florida, as Taiyaki NYC Miami. The ice cream and taiyaki waffles are made from the highest quality ingredients from socially responsible vendors and distributors. The taiyaki waffles are made fresh on-site, and the soft serve ice cream is produced and churned in small batches to preserve the true integrity of how a real soft serve should taste.
