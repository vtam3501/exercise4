The jam can be made from azuki beans but also with sesame seed, chestnuts, or rice cake (Mochi). Kakigori is a Japanese shaved ice dessert flavored with syrup and a sweetener, often condensed milk. Taiyaki (鯛焼き , literally "baked sea bream") is a Japanese fish-shaped cake. They are all famous and popular Japanese desserts that can be found in many dessert shops in New York City.

## Monaka

### About 
Monaka (最中) is a Japanese sweet made of azuki bean jam filling sandwiched between two thin crisp wafers made from mochi. The jam can be made from azuki beans but also with sesame seed, chestnuts, or rice cake (Mochi). Modern monaka can also be eaten filled with ice cream. The wafers can be square, triangular, or may be shaped like cherry blossoms, chrysanthemums and so on. Monaka is a type of dessert (wagashi) which is served with tea. There are still many very famous monaka specialty stores in Japan.

### Where to Buy It
Monaka can be bought in any Jaoanese supermarket. Depending on the manufacturers, there are many versions of monaka. For example, there are panda shaped ones, which are wonderful as a kid's treat, with chocolate and filled with vanilla cream. In another variation, it's aerated milk chocolate between those crispy wafers and imprinted with a flower pattern. Each seller of this popular snack has their own recipe and technique, meaning varieties can sometimes differ heavily. Accordingly, fans are always keen to seek out a new type and queues are not uncommon. 

## Kakigori 

### About 
Kakigori is a Japanese shaved ice dessert flavored with syrup and a sweetener, often condensed milk. The origins of kakigōri date back to the 11th century, when blocks of ice saved during the colder months would be shaved and served with sweet syrup to Japanese aristocracy during the summer. Kakigōri became more accessible in the 19th century, when ice became more widely available to the public during the summertime.

### Where to Buy It
Bonsai Kakigori is located in NYC. At Bonsai Kakigori, we ordered an original hand-cranked kakigōri machine from Japan, nicknamed it ”humi” after our favorite kakigōri shop in Tokyo, and began testing flavors. We started making some for friends and realized that the best part of making kakigōri was sharing it with others. So, Bonsai Kakigōri was born. We decided to name our company after the Bonsai tree. Even though Bonsai trees are Japanese in origin, it's up to the person to influence how it's grown and take shape. That's what we've set out to do with kakigōri. We seek to honor the Japanese roots of the dessert but make our own kind, influenced by our identity as New Yorkers.

## Taiyaki

### About 
Taiyaki (鯛焼き , literally "baked sea bream") is a Japanese fish-shaped cake. It imitates the shape of Tai (Japanese Red seabream). It is also the origin of the name. The most common filling is red bean paste that is made from sweetened azuki beans. Other common fillings may be custard, chocolate, cheese, or sweet potato. Some shops even sell taiyaki with okonomiyaki, gyoza filling, or a sausage inside.

### Where to Buy It
First established in the cultural melting pot of Chinatown, New York, Taiyaki NYC has since expanded to the arts district of Wynwood Miami, Florida, as Taiyaki NYC Miami. Our ice cream and taiyaki waffles are made from the highest quality ingredients from socially responsible vendors and distributors. Our taiyaki waffles are made fresh on-site, and our soft serve ice cream is produced and churned in small batches to preserve the true integrity of how a real soft serve should taste. We strive to keep our customers happy and satisfied while leaving a minimal footprint on our planet.Our goal is to work with and to give back to the community the best we can. By doing so, we hope to build a community store that is deeply rooted in the neighborhood we serve.
